Experiment parameters
    speed: 
        - motion_command.translation = 0 to 1.5
        - are we interested in backwards translation?
    turning speed:
        - ackermann turn: motion_command.rotation = 0 to 1.5 combined with motion_commandn.translation = 0 to 1.5
        - point turn: motion_command.rotation = 0 to 1.5
    camera pointing
    camera height
    ambient light: can it be changed "externally" (switch off the lab lights) or must be simulated in software (reducing exposure)?
    terrain texture : featureless sand, sand with tiny rocks, small rocks, big white-ish rocks
    terrain morphology: flat, flat with slope in front, slope, slope with flat in front
